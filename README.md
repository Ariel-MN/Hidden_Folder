## A program that hide folders from Windows OS interface.

<br>

### Information:

- **Requirements:** Windows OS, Python 3.7 or higer.

- **Python modules required:** _Pillow_**ยน**, pymongo, dnspython, cryptography.

- **Repository:** I have added an installer, this file (\*.exe) has the purpose to create the necessary files in the correct place for the system to guarantee the correct functioning of the program, using this file you won't have to install anything else. <br>
Note that to use the file "\*.py" directly it's necessary to install the Python interpreter and the libraries already cited above and read the [wiki](https://github.com/Ariel-MN/Hidden_Folder/wiki) and code of the script to understand how to use this program.
